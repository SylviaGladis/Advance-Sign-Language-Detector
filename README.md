# Advance-Sign-Language-Detector
A Python project using Medipipe, OpenCV, and Scikit-Learn capabilities for real-time hand sign detection. Accessible, the project captures hand gestures in a very fine-grained manner, providing an excel-lent starting point for many applications beyond this project, such as translation. Ideal for developers and researchers interested in sign language recognition and computer vision applications.
